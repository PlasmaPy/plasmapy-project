    * murderbot diaries <- book rec by Nick
* Nick will submit a poster abstract for PlasmaPy code stuff
    * Focus on what we've done for the last year and future goals
    * How to get involved
    * ...will open a google doc or something to get the abstract started
* We now have PlasmaPy email addresses through our Googleâ„¢ overlords
    * `dev@plasmapy.org`, `team@plasmapy.org`
* Hack week meetings now on Wednesdays & Fridays at 9 am PDT
    * could add `stanczakdominik@gmail.com`
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/SMu6bi5.jpg) StaÅ„czyk, not StaÅ„czak nor StaÅ„stick
    * [Helpful German pronunciation materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein_discography)
* Do something like [`docs/conf.py`](https://sdfasjklfsa.com) in reST?
    * No.
    * Nevermind.
    * `` `docs/conf.py` <the link>``_ .... `docutils` and/or `sphinx` can not properly parse this syntax
    * Would have to create a role that specifically adds this.
    * Could add an issue when `plasmapy_sphinx` is spun off.
    * Probably not worth the time and effort for us.
* Nick needs to add to presenters email list
* Dominik needs to model electrons in neoclassical
    * Using `IonizationState` and `IonizationStateCollection`
    * Need to include electrons in the modeling
    * In far future, might want a container that lets you access data like densities, temperatures, charges, etc. for multiple charge levels of multiple isotopes at once.
