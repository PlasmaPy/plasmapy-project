## Minutes

* How did the hack week go?
  * Pretty well, for first year!  Good `__init__` for the hack week.
  * Hack time was not what was expected.  Discussion seemed to fizzle out near the end sometimes.
    * Less actual coding than expected.
    * Not much volunteering for 
  * Maybe devote a day to a package.  Morning presentations/tutorials and afternoon activities.
  * Maybe make it more like a research software engineering summer school (git/GitHub, using Python, docs in Python, testing in Python)
  * Limited in what to achieve with a virtual meeting
  * Are we trying to replace PlasmaPy workshops with Hack Weeks?
    * We don't have capacity to do both right now
    * Astro Hack Week is separate from Astropy
  * Time zones...
    * We're posting videos, at least
    * Selective sessions that are for time zones that are on different continents
* Nick should make simulation working group one of the biggest priorities for the rest of the year
* Attempting to use ZenHub for `plasmapy.dispersion`
