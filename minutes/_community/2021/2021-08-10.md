## Minutes

* Switching from gile change log checker to a GitHub Actions checker
    * pllim/actions-towncrier-changelog@main
    * rocco8773/actions-towncrier-changelog@vRoc (my fork)
* Reviewing #1206
    * completed and merged
* Putting a lot of work into #1173
    * This one needs to get into 0.7.0
    * `volume_average_interpolate` now does...
        * only interpolates a point if it is bounded by 8 grid points
        * returns a `numpy.nan` if an interpolation point is outside the grid
    * Will need to greate issue/pr to update functionalty so that `volume_average_interpolator` and interpolate points in the skin of the grid volume (i.e. the 0.5*dx, 0.5*dy, 0.5*dz skin just outside the grid points)
* PR #1208 is looking good in review
    * some refactoring and `black` formatting is still needed
    * should make it for the `v0.7.0` release
* pre-commit on CI doesn't show what the errors are
    * There are GitHub Actions things for 
* There are official GitHub Actions for `isort` and `black` now
    * `isort/isort-action`
        * https://github.com/isort/isort-action
        * https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/github_action.html
    * `psf/black`
        * https://github.com/psf/black
        * https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrations/github_actions.html?highlight=action
    * I have set these up for `bapsflib` <https://github.com/BaPSF/bapsflib/blob/master/.github/workflows/linters.yml>
        * A huge benefit of this setup is that the version of `black` that is used is based on the pkg's `requirements.txt`, so there's additional maintence for the Action.
        * Currently we have to separately maintain this version in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and this has bit us several times in the past.
    * There also appears to be an action for `pre-commit`
        * https://github.com/pre-commit/action
        * This might allow us to scrap `.pre-commit-config.yaml` as well.
