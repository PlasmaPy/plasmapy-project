## Action Items

***Shane***
* Open PR to refactor `plasmapy.dispersion` and create the analytical sub-pkg

***Erik***
* Update PR #973 with the lists from today's meeting and convert it to an Epic

## Minutes

* [Last mtg](https://hackmd.io/@plasmapy/Hka7cdP1O) was in January before Ramiz got into super thesis mode
* Need to find ways to validate the functions.  
    * Some paper have plots that can be reproduced, like for Bellan solution.
    * Some solutions...it's hard to find plots, or sometimes maybe just for reduced limits. It gives numbers, but are they the right numbers?
    * Not necessarily a good solution at the moment.  Good to compare to plots, good to compare to existing functionality.
    * Should build in warnings when a dispersion relation is being used with invalid assumptions
    * Docs should include assumptions and regimes of validity.
* [Hollweg PR](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/1189)
    * Could replicate a plot in Hollweg's paper
    * Close to ready for a review
* Good to start with smaller pull requests. Good to start out with a refactoring, getting to the file structure discussed in [past meeting](https://hackmd.io/XDImSQ8iTsOxvtrGzHFexw)
* pkg structure for dispersion should follow
    ```bash
    plasmapy
    +-- dispersion
    |   +-- analytical/  # for solutions
    |   |   +-- __init__.py
    |   |   +-- two_fluid.py
    |   +-- numerical/  # for solvers
    |   |   +-- __init__.py
    |   |   +-- hollweg.py
    |   +-- __init__.py
    |   +-- core.py
    |   +-- dispersionfucntion.py
    ```
* What analytical solutions do we want in PlasmaPy? (all taken from bellan2012)
    - [x] Bellan soln
    - [ ] Hasegawa eqn 5
* What numerical solvers do we want in PlasmaPy? (all taken from bellan2012)
    - [ ] Hollweg...solving eqn 3
    - [ ] Hirose...solving eqn 7
    - [ ] Chen and Wu **??** section 1.5
    - [ ] Stix cold plasma...solving eqn 9
* Next steps
    1. Open a PR that refactors current code into the above file structure for the analyical sub-pkg
    2. Review and impelment Hollweg solver PR #1189
        * define the solver
        * create the numberical file structure in `plasmapy.dispersion`
        * will need a notebook but we can do one of the following options
            1. include notebook in PR
            2. open issue to create notebook
            3. open PR for notebook in parallel
    3. Creating a factory function
        * a possible model
            ```python
            def two_fluid_solution(branch="bellan"):
                """This is a factory function."""
                _solns = {
                    "bellan": two_fluid_bellan,
                    "hasegawa": two_fluid_hasegawa,
                }
                _soln = _solns[branch]

                ...

            def two_fluid_bellan():
                ...

            def two_fluid_hasegawa():
                ...
            ```
        * do we want a factory function for soutions and solvers or one factory func to rule them all?
        *
